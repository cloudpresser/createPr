# Coding Conventions for AI Coding Assistant

This document outlines the coding conventions and best practices to be followed when developing and maintaining our AI Coding Assistant project.

## General Principles

1. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid duplicating code. Extract common functionality into reusable functions or modules.

2. **UNIX Philosophy**: Follow UNIX-like principles:
   - Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
   - Write programs to work together.
   - Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

3. **Industry Best Practices**: Adhere to widely accepted industry standards and best practices for the languages and frameworks used in the project.

## Specific Guidelines

### Code Style

1. Use consistent indentation (preferably spaces over tabs).
2. Follow language-specific style guides (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, Airbnb for JavaScript).
3. Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.

### Code Organization

1. Organize code into logical modules and packages.
2. Keep files and functions focused on a single responsibility.
3. Use appropriate design patterns where applicable.

### Documentation

1. Include clear and concise comments in the code where necessary.
2. Maintain up-to-date README files for each major component.
3. Use docstrings or equivalent for functions, classes, and modules.

### Version Control

1. Write clear, concise commit messages.
2. Use feature branches for development and pull requests for code reviews.
3. Keep commits atomic and focused on a single change.

### Testing

1. Write unit tests for all new functionality.
2. Maintain high test coverage.
3. Include integration and end-to-end tests where appropriate.

### Error Handling

1. Use appropriate error handling mechanisms (e.g., try-catch blocks).
2. Provide meaningful error messages.
3. Log errors and exceptions properly.

### Performance

1. Write efficient code, but prioritize readability and maintainability.
2. Optimize only when necessary and after profiling.

### Security

1. Follow security best practices for the specific technologies used.
2. Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
3. Sanitize user inputs and validate data.

Remember, these conventions are guidelines to help maintain code quality and consistency. They should be reviewed and updated periodically as the project evolves.
